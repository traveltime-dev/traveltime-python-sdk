# Travel Time Python SDK

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/traveltimepy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/traveltimepy) [![Unit Tests](https://github.com/traveltime-dev/traveltime-python-sdk/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/traveltime-dev/traveltime-python-sdk/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Python support](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7+-blue.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7+-blue)

[Travel Time](https://docs.traveltime.com/api/overview/introduction) Python SDK helps users find locations by journey
time rather than using ‘as the crow flies’ distance.  
Time-based searching gives users more opportunities for personalisation and delivers a more relevant search.

## Usage

## Installation

Install Travel Time Python SDK in a `virtualenv` using `pip`. `virtualenv` is a tool to create isolated Python
environments.

`virtualenv` allows to install Travel Time Python SDK without needing system install permissions, and without clashing
with the installed system dependencies.

### Linux/Mac

```
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv <your-env>
source <your-env>/bin/activate
<your-env>/bin/pip install traveltimepy
```

### Windows

```
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv <your-env>
<your-env>\Scripts\activate
<your-env>\Scripts\pip.exe install traveltimepy
```

#### Example:

```python
import asyncio

from traveltimepy import Location, Coordinates, Transportation, TravelTimeSdk

async def main():
    sdk = TravelTimeSdk("YOUR_APP_ID", "YOUR_APP_KEY")
    
    locations = [
        Location(id="London center", coords=Coordinates(lat=51.508930, lng=-0.131387)),
        Location(id="Hyde Park", coords=Coordinates(lat=51.508824, lng=-0.167093)),

### [Time Filter Fast (Proto)](https://docs.traveltime.com/api/reference/travel-time-distance-matrix-proto)

A fast version of time filter communicating using [protocol buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).

The request parameters are much more limited and only travel time is returned. In addition, the results are only
approximately correct (95% of the results are guaranteed to be within 5% of the routes returned by regular time filter).
This inflexibility comes with a benefit of faster response times (Over 5x faster compared to regular time filter) and
larger limits on the amount of destination points.

#### Takes:

* origin: Coordinates - Origin point.
* destinations: List[Coordinates] - Destination points. Cannot be more than 200,000.
* transportation: ProtoTransportation - Transportation type.
* travel_time: int - Time limit. Maximum value is 7200.
* country: ProtoCountry - Return the results that are within the specified country.

#### Returns:

* travel_times: List[int] - The responses are in the form of a list where each position denotes either a travel time (in
  seconds) of a journey, or if negative that the journey from the origin to the destination point is impossible.

#### Example:

```python
import asyncio
from traveltimepy import ProtoCountry, Coordinates, ProtoTransportation, TravelTimeSdk

async def main():
    sdk = TravelTimeSdk("YOUR_APP_ID", "YOUR_APP_KEY")
    travel_times = await sdk.time_filter_proto_async(
        origin=Coordinates(lat=51.425709, lng=-0.122061),
        destinations=[
            Coordinates(lat=51.348605, lng=-0.314783),
            Coordinates(lat=51.337205, lng=-0.315793)
        ],
        transportation=ProtoTransportation.DRIVING_FERRY,
        travel_time=7200,
        country=ProtoCountry.UNITED_KINGDOM
    )
    
    print(travel_times)

asyncio.run(main())
```

* departure_time: datetime - Leave departure location at no earlier than given time. Cannot be specified with
  arrival_time.
* transportation: Union - Transportation mode and related parameters.

### [Map Info](https://docs.traveltime.com/api/reference/map-info)

Returns information about currently supported countries.

It is useful when you have an application that can do searches in any country that we support, you can use Supported
Locations to get the map name for a certain point and then use this endpoint to check what features are available for
that map. That way you could show fares for routes in the maps that support it.

#### Returns:

* maps: List[Map]
* name - An internal map id. The first two characters usually correspond to the ISO 3166-2 standard (e.g th, ie)
  sometimes followed by additional characters (e.g ca_pst, us_pst). To get features of a specific map, use the map
  info endpoint.
* features - Features that are supported in the specified map

#### Example:

```python
import asyncio
from traveltimepy import TravelTimeSdk

async def main():
    sdk = TravelTimeSdk("YOUR_APP_ID", "YOUR_APP_KEY")
    results = await sdk.map_info_async()
    print(results)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### [Supported Locations](https://docs.traveltime.com/api/reference/supported-locations)

#### Returns:

* locations: List[SupportedLocation]
* id - Location id that you specified in the request.
* map_name - An internal map id. The first two characters usually correspond to the ISO 3166-2 standard (e.g th, ie)
  sometimes followed by additional characters (e.g ca_pst, us_pst). To get features of a specific map, use the map
  info endpoint.
* additional_map_names - In case the location is in more than one map, other map ids are listed here.
* unsupported_locations: List[str] - List that contains ids of locations that are unsupported.

#### Example:

```python
import asyncio
from traveltimepy import Location, Coordinates, TravelTimeSdk

async def main():
    sdk = TravelTimeSdk("YOUR_APP_ID", "YOUR_APP_KEY")
    
    locations = [
