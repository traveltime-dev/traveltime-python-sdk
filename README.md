[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/traveltimepy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/traveltimepy) [![Unit Tests](https://github.com/traveltime-dev/traveltime-python-sdk/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/traveltime-dev/traveltime-python-sdk/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Python support](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7+-blue.svg)](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7+-blue)

[Travel Time](https://docs.traveltime.com/api/overview/introduction) Python SDK helps users find locations by journey time rather than using ‘as the crow flies’ distance.  
Time-based searching gives users more opportunities for personalisation and delivers a more relevant search.

## Usage

### Installation

`pip install traveltimepy`

### Authentication

In order to authenticate with Travel Time API, you will have to supply the Application Id and Api Key.

```python
from traveltimepy import TravelTimeSdk

sdk = TravelTimeSdk('YOUR_APP_ID', 'YOUR_APP_KEY')
```

### Concurrent calls 
Each method below has its own asynchronous version.

#### Example:
```python
from datetime import datetime

from traveltimepy import Driving, Coordinates, TravelTimeSdk

sdk = TravelTimeSdk('YOUR_APP_ID', 'YOUR_APP_KEY')

res = await sdk.time_map_async(
    coordinates=[Coordinates(lat=51.507609, lng=-0.128315), Coordinates(lat=51.517609, lng=-0.138315)],
    arrival_time=datetime.now(),
    transportation=Driving()
)
```

### [Time Filter (Fast)](https://docs.traveltime.com/api/reference/time-filter-fast)

A very fast version of ```time_filter()```. However, the request parameters are much more limited. Currently only supports UK and Ireland.

#### Takes:
* locations: List[Locations] - All locations. Location ids must be unique.
* search_ids: Dict[str, List[str]] - Searches from a target location to destinations.
  You can define up to 100,000 destinations

  Default value is False.
  
#### Returns:
* results: List[TimeFilterFastResult] - The results list of reachable and unreachable locations.

#### Example:

```python
from traveltimepy import Location, Coordinates, Transportation, TravelTimeSdk

sdk = TravelTimeSdk('YOUR_APP_ID', 'YOUR_APP_KEY')
locations = [
    Location(id='London center', coords=Coordinates(lat=51.508930, lng=-0.131387)),
    Location(id='Hyde Park', coords=Coordinates(lat=51.508824, lng=-0.167093)),
    Location(id='ZSL London Zoo', coords=Coordinates(lat=51.536067, lng=-0.153596))
]

results = sdk.time_filter_fast(
    locations=locations,
    search_ids={
        'London center': ['Hyde Park', 'ZSL London Zoo'],
        'ZSL London Zoo': ['Hyde Park', 'London center'],
    },
    transportation=Transportation(type='public_transport'),
    one_to_many=False
)
print(results)
```

### [Time Filter Fast (Proto)](https://docs.traveltime.com/api/reference/travel-time-distance-matrix-proto)

A fast version of time filter communicating using [protocol buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).

The request parameters are much more limited and only travel time is returned. 
In addition, the results are only approximately correct (95% of the results are guaranteed to be within 5% of the routes returned by regular time filter).
This inflexibility comes with a benefit of faster response times (Over 5x faster compared to regular time filter) and larger limits on the amount of destination points.

#### Takes:
* origin: Coordinates - Origin point.
* destinations: List[Coordinates] - Destination points. Cannot be more than 200,000.
* transportation: ProtoTransportation - Transportation type.
* travel_time: int - Time limit. Maximum value is 7200.
* country: ProtoCountry - Return the results that are within the specified country.

#### Returns:
* travel_times: List[int] - The responses are in the form of a list where each position denotes either a
travel time (in seconds) of a journey, or if negative that the journey from the
origin to the destination point is impossible.


#### Example:
```python
from traveltimepy import ProtoCountry, Coordinates, ProtoTransportation, TravelTimeSdk

sdk = TravelTimeSdk('YOUR_APP_ID', 'YOUR_APP_KEY')

travel_times = sdk.time_filter_proto(
    origin=Coordinates(lat=51.425709, lng=-0.122061),
    destinations=[
        Coordinates(lat=51.348605, lng=-0.314783),
        Coordinates(lat=51.337205, lng=-0.315793)
    ],
    transportation=ProtoTransportation.DRIVING,
    travel_time=7200,
    country=ProtoCountry.UNITED_KINGDOM
)
print(travel_times)
```


### [Routes](https://docs.traveltime.com/api/reference/routes)

* departure_time: datetime - Leave departure location at no earlier than given time. Cannot be specified with arrival_time.
* transportation: Union - Transportation mode and related parameters.
* properties: List[Property] - Properties to be returned about the postcodes. Default value is travel_time.

Returns information about currently supported countries.

It is useful when you have an application that can do searches in any country that we support, you can use Supported Locations to get the map name for a certain point and then use this endpoint to check what features are available for that map. That way you could show fares for routes in the maps that support it.

#### Returns:

  * name - An internal map id. The first two characters usually correspond to the ISO 3166-2 standard (e.g th, ie) sometimes followed by additional characters (e.g ca_pst, us_pst). To get features of a specific map, use the map info endpoint.
  * features - Features that are supported in the specified map 
    
#### Example:
```python
from traveltimepy import TravelTimeSdk

sdk = TravelTimeSdk('YOUR_APP_ID', 'YOUR_APP_KEY')
maps = sdk.map_info()
print(maps)
```

### [Supported Locations](https://docs.traveltime.com/api/reference/supported-locations)

Find out what points are supported by our api. The returned map name for a point can be used to determine what features are supported.

#### Takes:

#### Returns: 
* locations: List[SupportedLocation]
  * id - Location id that you specified in the request.
  * map_name - An internal map id. The first two characters usually correspond to the ISO 3166-2 standard (e.g th, ie) sometimes followed by additional characters (e.g ca_pst, us_pst). To get features of a specific map, use the map info endpoint.
  * additional_map_names - In case the location is in more than one map, other map ids are listed here.
* unsupported_locations: List[str] - List that contains ids of locations that are unsupported.

#### Example:
```python
from traveltimepy import Location, Coordinates, TravelTimeSdk

sdk = TravelTimeSdk('YOUR_APP_ID', 'YOUR_APP_KEY')

    Location(id='Lisbon', coords=Coordinates(lat=38.721869, lng=-9.138549)),
]
response = sdk.supported_locations(locations)
print(response.locations)
print(response.unsupported_locations)
```
